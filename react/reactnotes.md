# two ways 
1. npx create-react-app
2. npm create vite@latest

<></> - fragment

1. when making components, always capitalize name(function).
2. file extension .jsx , bcz some libraries like vite force us for that
3. return only 1 components


# Learnings:-
1) For Custom React (BTS of React) - in HTML  create div attach js , In JS - get that div and create our own custom Element(as like react sees element)  then for rendering we create a custom render methods which create the element in HTML and injects it in the div or container
2) When we create a component in react by default babel(Transpiler) will inject a element React.createElement ()
3) we declare as type ,attribute , children , Evaluated Expression(final answer code after expression ) 

# HOOKS in react 
methods to update the ui component 
1) Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
2) Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
3) Hooks cannot be conditional

# Hydration
In web development, hydration or rehydration is a technique in which client-side JavaScript converts a static HTML web page,
delivered either through static hosting or server-side rendering, into a dynamic web page by attaching event handlers to the HTML 
elements.

# What is reconciliation?
reconciliation
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
update
A change in the data used to render a React app. Usually the result of `setState`. Eventually results in a re-render.

Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM." A high-level description goes something like 
this: when you render a React application, a tree of nodes that describes the app is generated and saved in memory. This tree is then 
flushed to the rendering environment â€” for example, in the case of a browser application, it's translated to a set of DOM operations. 
When the app is updated (usually via setState), a new tree is generated. The new tree is diffed with the previous tree to compute which 
operations are needed to update the rendered app.

Although Fiber is a ground-up rewrite of the reconciler, the high-level algorithm described in the React docs will be largely the same. 

# The key points are:
1) Different component types are assumed to generate substantially different trees. React will not attempt to diff them, but rather replace the old tree completely.
2) Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique."

# some more important points -
1. The createRoot create's its own DOM and then compare it with the web browser's DOM and only update those components which are 
actually updated.
2. But the browser removes the whole DOM and then recrates the whole DOM with the updated values this is called reload.
3. However virtual DOM tracks whole DOM like a tree like structure and updates only those values which were only changed.
4. But some values depends on network call so if we update a value it might get update immediately via a network call.
5. So we will have to update it again. To avoid this overhead we can drop the updation calls for the immediate value update.
6. The current algo used by the React is called the React Fibre algo.
7. The algo react uses to differentiate the web browser's tree and React's tree formed through create root is called reconciliation.
8. Reconciliation is the algo behind what popularly known as the Virtual-DOM.
9. In UI it is not necessary for every update to be applied immediately.

# React props 
-: to send data from one component to another.

Props are sent inside the component brackets.
eg. <Card channel = "chaiaurcode"/> 
1 Always use curly brackets for a variable { variableName } to send it as props.
Props can be in any form but passed as a variable.
eg. <Card username = "chaiaurcode"/> 
eg. <Card object = "myobject"/> 
eg. <Card array = "myarray"/> 

2 props send the data in the object form to the component.
so to access ->      props.properties or {properties ="defaultValue if props doesn't receive any value"}
eg.props.username

# Detailed explaination of why does first syntax only updates the count once:
Initial State: Assume count is initially 69.
First Call: setCount(count + 1) schedules a state update to set count to 70 (69 + 1).
Second Call: setCount(count + 1) schedules another state update to set count to 70 (69 + 1), because count is still 69 in this scope.
Third Call: setCount(count + 1) schedules yet another state update to set count to 70 (69 + 1), again because count is still 69 in this scope.

In case of functional updater syntax React ensures that changes are made to the latest state of the count hence each function gets access to the latest state of the count variable:
First Call: setCount(count =>count+1) schedules a state update to set count to 70
Second Call : schedules a state update to set count to (70+1) because count is now 70 in this scope
